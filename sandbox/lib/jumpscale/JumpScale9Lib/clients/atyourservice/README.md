# JumpScale Client for AYS

The AYS client makes interacting with the RESTful API of a local or remote AYS Server easy.

This AYS client is actually a wrapper for the AYS client that is auto-generated from the [RAML specification of the AYS RESTful API](https://github.com/Jumpscale/ays9/blob/master/JumpScale9AYS/ays/server/apidocs/api.raml).

The auto-generated client is available through the `_ayscl` attribute of the AYS client. 

See [How to use the AYS client](/docs/Howto/AYS_client.md) for getting started instructions.
